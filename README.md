# Sales_Pipeline_Analysis


In this project, I analyzed product performance through a variety of lenses for a Sales Pipeline using Excel.

A sales company asked its analysts to perform a product performance analysis to find which products were performing poorly and possible solutions.
Below are the results.

You can see the dashboard I created using Excel [here].

I also performed the same commands using SQL [here].

# Data Structure and Validation


# Executive Summary

In order to pinpoint which products were performing poorly and which were performing well, we first needed to decide on key metrics for evaluation.
We decided to use Close Percentage as well as total sales in combination because this allowed us to find which products had the greatest room for growth.
